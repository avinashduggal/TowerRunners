## Project Summary
The goal of this project for our team, Tower Runners, is to developing a strategy using machine learning to solve the intricate puzzles introduced by the game Obstacle Towers. The problem we set out to solve was figuring out a method to develop a model that is capable of navigating throughout randomly generated puzzles, and obstacles in order to ascend to higher floors of the game (Insert images of the Obstacle Tower environment, keys, and puzzles). Considering Obstacle Towers was developed with the intention of examining the capabilities of reinforcement learning through its increasingly difficult puzzles, obstacles, and needs for computer vision and generalization skills, the team didn't need to perform additional set up to begin these tasks. 

## Approach
A baseline model that used to benchmark the other methods we planned to use was by using a Random Policy to sample moves to our agent. This model omitted the need for training because it would continuously decide on random actions to take until the end of each episode. 

Mention PPO, PPO with rewards (sprase and dense rewards), and Rainbow models. Include the reasons for why we decided to use these models and implemented changes to the environment. What was the objective and how would using these methods help us in completing our task.
